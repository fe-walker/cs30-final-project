# Beta Testing 

## My dad (knows some programming)
- said the instructions could be a little clearer 
- it broke a lot while he was playing and his main comment was that he'd rather it be usable instead of pretty looking
- liked the concept a lot

## Molly Reynolds (knows nothing about programming)
- Her first comment when trying the game was that she thought she broke it, which i knew exactly what was wrong when she sent me a photo, and it was a little error i hadn't bothered to fix sooner that i didn't think would cause confusion (but i fixed it).
- she also mentionned that the font was readable but hard to make out
- said instructions were clear
- Felt like an actual game
- said she really liked the pixelated art
