# Project Reflection

- I would tell myself to pre-plan the story and ALL the resources used. It would've saved so much time with writing and drawing
- I put off the sound for longer than i should have to focus on fixing bugs, so thats one thing missing from my needs to have list. 
- The hardest part was probably time management, as well as resolving small issues that didn't trigger an error. Or even trying to build the 'qestion' system so that it would be null after the question is asked but still do what it's supposed to, like when you're in the saloon talking to the barkeep and it's meant to trigger 'would you like to speak to them' because it's still true after asking if you'd like to enter the saloon it automatically goes through the text array and then asks the question.
- (problems i couldn't solve)
