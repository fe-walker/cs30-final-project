# CS30 Major Project

## Description
I want to build an adventure type game, similar to the dungeon crawler games from the exemplars, taking inspiration from The Oregon Trail. It'll probably be more western than medival/fantasy dungeon, and interactive prompts to make choices.

## Needs to have list
- WASD to move
- interact with objects around
- map
- pixelated images
- player character
- yes/no (y/n) prompts 
- text input options

## Nice to have list
- sounds/sound effects
- movement animation
- option to choose what the player looks like?
